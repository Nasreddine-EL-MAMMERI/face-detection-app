## Description
Welcome to my first face detection application using deep learning, OpenCV, and Streamlit. This application allows you to detect faces in images and provides an interactive interface for trying it out.

## Live Demo
Try out the [live demo](https://face-detection-app-3eixpe0e81b.streamlit.app/) deployed on Streamlit Share.

hi; 
in this repository , i am glad to share with you my first face detection application using deep learning , Opencv and Streamlit share.
i used DNN function in OPencv to create the app, after that i used streamlit to share it on the cloud.
for that i created this URL: https://face-detection-app-3eixpe0e81b.streamlit.app/ if you want to try it!

Enjoy!!

Nas.
